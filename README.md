### Motivation

All around the world internet freedoms are being eroded by governments, restricting communications. For example, in Venezuala in 2014 the internet was turned off and modes of communcation were blocked. We wanted to create a secure, decentralised communications network that would enable secure conversations to take place without the internet.

mesheeChat is a 2 week project which uses the mesh networking tool CJDNS in combination with Node.js to provide secure chat over a mesh network. We prototyped the network using Raspberry Pis and tested using Mocha and Webdriver.io.

##Why Bother?

Mesh networks are free from central controll

Meshed network vs Internet Service Provider (ISP)

1. Centralised authority control-freed 
2. Robustness in natural disaster
3. Politically free
4. No more monitoring from oppresive regimes

### Security
